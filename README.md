## Introduction
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The game consists of a grid of cells that can live, die, or multiply based on a few mathematical rules. The goal of the game is to observe the evolution of patterns over time.

## Features
- Simple and intuitive graphical user interface using Swing.
- Configurable grid size.
- Adjustable simulation speed.

## How to run
- Clone the project
- Run it with gradle `./gradlew run`

## Usage
- Open the application.
- Configure the grid size.
- Click on the field to add pattern.
- Adjust the speed of the simulation using the controls.
